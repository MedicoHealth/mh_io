    <p>After closely looking at the possibilities for global and efficient use of blockchain
technology in healthcare, with actual state of the art of technology in mind, we came up
with Medicohealth Platform.</p>

<p>Medicohealth is a blockchain-based project designed to improve a fragmented healthcare
system, where we know we can make a significant difference for the better, by tackling just
one truly important issue – the need of prompt, affordable, and reliable consultation about
a patient’s condition from a physician or a specialist of their choosing</p>

    <p>Medicohealth Platform will allow for fully anonymous, safe, and efficient communication
with the world’s leading physicians. Physician credentials, together with license validity
information, are updated in an immutable decentralised database. Patient data will be
anonymously stored and accessed only by selected physicians for a limited time, whereas
patient will maintain full control over which physician can access his medical data, and to
what extent</p>
